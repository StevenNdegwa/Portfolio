## Description
This is a portfolio of all the projects i have done as software developer. These include Moringa1, Identproject and My-first-website. The links to the projects are on the page.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to [install any dependencies](http://github.com)? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?
## Known Bugs
Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place.
## Technologies Used
Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used [HTML and CSS](http://github.com). If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out. ~~please stop using outdated technologies~~
## Support and contact details
Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.
