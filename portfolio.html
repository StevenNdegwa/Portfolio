  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I studied finance in college and worked two years in retail finance. since i was young i have always loved numbers so when i got to college i immediately signed up for the finance major and loved it ever since. I also like that my work in finance would affect the well being of normal people in the world.</p>
    <p>I decided to learn how to code in order to be able to intergrate those skills with work in the finance sector. I also love learning new skills. Coding would also help me stay competitive in the market place. it would also enable me to build things such as apps from scratch.</p>
    <p>In my free time i like to go hiking and i jog everyday around the neighborhood. I also like travelling to different parts of Kenya. I have been to most of the national parks in Kenya.</p>
