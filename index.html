  <h4 id="about">About Me</h4>
    <div class="bio">
    <p>I studied <strong>finance</strong> in college and worked two years in <em>retail finance.</em> Since i was young i have always loved numbers so when i got to college i immediately signed up for the finance major and loved it ever since. I also like that my work in finance would affect the well being of normal people in the world.</p>
    <p>I decided to learn how to <strong>code in order</strong> to be able to intergrate those skills with work in the finance sector. I also love learning new skills. Coding would also help me stay competitive in the market place. it would also enable me to build things such as apps from scratch.</p>
    <p>In my free time i like to go hiking and i jog everyday around the neighborhood. I also like travelling to different parts of Kenya. I have been to most of the national parks in Kenya.</p>
